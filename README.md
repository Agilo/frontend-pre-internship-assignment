# Agilo frontend pre-internship case

Build a simple storefront that displays products in a grid (landing page) and allows customers to visit a details page for each product.

### Functional requirements

- As a customer, I should be able to view a list of all products
- As a customer, I should be able to filter products by collection
- As a customer, I should be able to visit a product details page
- As a customer, I should be able to choose among the product variants

### Minimum technical requirements

- Storefront should be built with Next.js, Gatsby, or CRA
- Storefront should consume medusa [Store API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/) using pre-built hooks library `medusa-react` or JS SDK `@medusajs/medusa-js`
- Storefront should be built using a modular component-based approach

### Preferred technical requirements

- Storefront should use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Storefront is responsive
- Storefront is built with TypeScript

Also, we always encourage and highly appreciate creativity, so please feel free to give it your touch to make your solution stand out.

## Prerequisites

Before getting your hands dirty with the frontend implementation, we need to set you up with a Medusa server. Use medusa [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start/) to get it up and running in a few minutes. Additionally, you might find Admin of good use. Follow [these steps](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart) to set that up as well.

ðŸ’¡ If any of these prerequisites are causing you issues, please ping us (internship@agilo.com) immediately as this should not be a blocker for the rest of the case

## Letâ€™s go!

Your job is now to make changes to the storefront. There are no design requirements for the project, but the following rough sketch should get you going.

## Deliverables

- An open-source repository containing the source code of the application
- A README with the following
    - Short description of the project
        - Time spent
        - The implementation that was most challenging
        - The implementation you are most proud of
    - Concise description of how you structured the project and any considerations you might have had

### What weâ€™ll be looking for

- Production-ready clean code
- Sophisticated technical design choices
- Level of readability i.e. how easy will it be to collaborate on the project afterward
- Level of sustainability i.e. how long will the implementation last as is
- Level of creativity
- Sensible git history

We are looking very much forward to the result - happy coding!
